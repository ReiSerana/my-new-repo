            <h3>Speeltuin Erfgooierskwartier (Hilversum)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Address: Erfgooiersstraat 92A, 1222 BC, Hilversum</li>
                    <li> Description / Features: This playground is well known in the Hilversum area. It sits adjacent to the heath (Hilversumse Heide). It offers a mix of climbing structures, swings, and open play space. There is a café-style kiosk and a terrace area for parents, with picknick tables available.</li>
                    <li>Facilities: Toilets (with baby changing / commode) are available. You may bring your own food and drink (though some restrictions apply on terrace use)</li>
                    <li>Safety / Enclosure: Not all detailed safety features are documented, but given the location next to open heath and active playground association, supervision is expected; check before arrival.</li>
                    <li>Accessibility & Transport: Close to local streets; parking or public transport options should be verified locally.</li>
                    <li>Tips: Bring your own snacks. The terrace offers a good view while children play. For quieter visits, consider mornings or weekdays.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Speeltuin De Zoutkeet (Hilversum)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Location: In Hilversum South, not far from the heathland area </li>
                <li>Description / Features: An inclusive and well-enclosed playground. Good for the smallest children. It features multiple sandboxes (one with water pump), swings, a zip line / cable ride, climbing equipment, and more.</li>
                <li>Safety & Accessibility: The playground is fenced / enclosed, which is especially useful for toddlers. It includes a swing accessible from a wheelchair and a roundabout that can be used by children with mobility needs. </li>
                <li>Facilities: Good shade options, benches, and space for parents to sit.</li>
                <li>Tips: Because it is inclusive, it’s a good option for families with children of differing mobility. Bring water and plan for shade when the sun is strong. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Speelbos ’t Laer (near Hilversum / Laren area)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Address: Oude Postweg 1, 1251 SE Laren (on the edge of the Hilversum area)</li>
                <li>Description / Features: This is more of a nature play forest than a classic playground. Children can play with natural elements: sand, water, tree trunks, hills, rocks, climbing in trees, hiding paths, and a natural sound instrument (“metallophone”) made of logs.</li>
                <li>Facilities: Picnic tables are provided for families. However, there is no full café or terrace, so bring food and supplies. </li>
                <li>Enclosure & Safety: Though the forest playground is in a natural setting, there is a wooden boundary (partial enclosure) that helps prevent children from wandering too far.</li> 
                <li>Accessibility & Transport: Some paths may be rugged or uneven; not all parts of the playground may be suitable for strollers or wheelchairs.</li>
                <li>Tips: Great for adventurous children who enjoy “messy play.” Bring a picnic, water, and wear clothes that can get dirty. Mornings are typically less crowded.</li>
