Parents can find a calm and welcoming environment where children can read, play, and participate in creative activities.
The library regularly organizes storytelling sessions for young children, creative craft afternoons, and small-scale workshops that introduce kids to technology and media. These sessions are designed to encourage curiosity and learning in a relaxed, hands-on way.
Servicepunt Noord is also known for its Mini Techlab sessions, where children aged 4–8 can explore simple technology projects such as coding basics, building with LEGO WeDo, or creating small digital artworks. These activities are supervised by friendly staff and often align with seasonal or educational themes.</li>
                <li>Opening Hours & Program Schedule:
Programs at Servicepunt Noord typically take place during the week, often in the afternoons, to fit school schedules. The library follows the same general opening hours as the central location, but some activities may vary depending on the season or holidays.

Families are encouraged to check the schedule regularly for new programs or one-off special activities like holiday crafts or themed reading events.</li>
